# Lab overview

This lab walks you through how to use the [Puppet Palo Alto firewall](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/panos) module with [puppet device](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.4/puppet_device.html). At the end of this lab, you will have set up the module to work with `puppet device` for both getting and setting data. This can be extended to work with Puppet Enterprise using the [Device Manager](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/device_manager) module. No prior knowledge of Panos is required.
