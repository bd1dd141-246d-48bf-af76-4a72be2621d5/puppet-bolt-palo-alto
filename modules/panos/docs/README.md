# Palo Alto labs

There are two Palo Alto labs available:

1. [How to use the Palo Alto module with Bolt](./01-using-with-bolt/README.md)
2. [How to use the Palo Alto module with Puppet device](./02-using-with-puppet-device/README.md). Note that this module extends to work with Puppet Enterprise (PE).

These labs are intended for new users. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
