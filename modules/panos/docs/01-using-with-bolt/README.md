# Lab overview

This lab walks you through how to use the [Puppet Palo Alto firewall](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/panos) module with [Puppet Bolt](https://puppet.com/products/bolt). At the end of the lab, you will have used Bolt to run tasks and apply a manifest at the command line. No prior knowledge of Panos or Bolt is required.
